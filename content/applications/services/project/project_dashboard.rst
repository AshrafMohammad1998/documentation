Project dashboard
=================

The project dashboard allows you to get a comprehensive overview of your project's status. It
displays information such as the total number of tasks, timesheets, and planned hours linked to the
project, as well as detailed information about project milestones and its costs and revenues.

As such, it is a crucial tool for effective project management and for ensuring that your project
stays on track.

To access the project dashboard, open the **Project** app, click the vertical ellipsis
(:guilabel:`⋮`), and select :guilabel:`Dashboard`.
